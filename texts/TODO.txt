Fix all (c) and license info
Get matthias to pick a (c) and a name
Make sure that things like the license
	are copied into the binary app build.
Ascii text file with supported drivers
Write scripts to generate .dmg files and
    automate versionnumbering based on 
    cvs tags
Fixup all .cvsignore files and/or collect them
    in a CVSROOT/cvsignore file for things such
    as .DS_Store
Domain - would it make sense to make this a 
    org.sourceforge.webcam-os in the application
    settings field - or does the lattter not
    do anything but has to be unique; in which
    case de.matthias-krauss.macam is fine and
    a nice historic reminder.
